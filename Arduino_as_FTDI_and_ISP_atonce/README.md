# **Using Arduino as FTDI and ISP at once**
**Here I've used Arduino to communicate with atmega328p and computer.
Similarly to make instance changes in the program uploded to avr, I've
used the same Arduino to program the avr. For this I just have to make
some small changes. The detail procedure is shown below.**

**Step1:**Connect the ICSP headers of the Arduino with the corresponding
avr pins. The description of each pin of ICSP can be seen in the picture.
